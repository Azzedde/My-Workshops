    "We will take a deep dive into a hands-on example: crafting a user-friendly web interface for image recognition, powered by the classical VGG19 pre-trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying a model into production is paramount. It's the bridge that transforms our sophisticated algorithms and intricate data science workflows into tangible, real-world applications, enhancing user experiences and solving practical problems.\n",

    "## Creating/Importing the model\n",
    "The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that I've chosen to leverage for our image classification task is VGG-19, a deep learning model heralded for its efficacy. Developed by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford, VGG-19 is a part of the VGG family, renowned for its depth and the consistency of its architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of VGG-19 is rooted in its robustness and proven accuracy in discerning intricate patterns and features in images, a capability cultivated through its training on millions of images from the ImageNet database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our `model.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading the Model**: We've set up the necessary code to initialize and load the pre-trained VGG-19 weights. This allows us to harness the power of this deep learning model without undergoing the extensive and time-consuming training process from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Preprocessing**: Images from diverse sources come in various sizes, resolutions, and formats. To ensure our VGG-19 model can interpret and analyze these images, they need to be transformed into a consistent format. Our preprocessing step handles tasks like resizing images to the requisite dimensions, normalizing pixel values, and potentially augmenting the data to enhance prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Making Predictions**: The final section of the model.py is geared towards taking a preprocessed image, feeding it through our VGG-19 model, and obtaining the predicted class or label. The output is typically a probability distribution over all possible classes, and the class with the highest probability becomes our model's prediction."

    "## Containerization with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "![Docker logo](Docker-Symbol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world of microservices and scalable applications, having a consistent environment is paramount to ensure smooth operations and to prevent the notorious \"it works on my machine\" syndrome. That's where Docker comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to \"containerize\" your applications, encapsulating them into packages called containers. These containers bundle an application's code, configurations, dependencies, and runtime into a single unit, ensuring it runs consistently across various environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Since everything your application needs to run is bundled into a container, you eliminate the \"works on my machine\" problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Isolation**: Each container runs in isolation, ensuring that the environment remains pure and there are no conflicting dependencies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Scalability and Portability**: Docker containers are lightweight, making it easier to scale microservices and move them between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Dockerize Our Flask Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If you haven't already, the first thing to do is to [download and install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List Dependencies**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your main directory. This file should list all the necessary Python packages required for your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Flask==x.x.x\n",
    "   tensorflow==x.x.x\n",
    "   keras==x.x.x\n",
    "   werkzeug==x.x.x\n",
    "   ... (and so on)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dockerfile Creation**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The Dockerfile is essentially your recipe for how Docker should build the container. Create a file named `Dockerfile` (with no extension) in your directory. This file will contain instructions to set up the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```Dockerfile\n",
    "   FROM python:3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "   WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "   COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\n",
    "   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "   COPY . .\n",
    "\n",
    "   CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build the Docker Image**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker build -t recog_container:api .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory, tag it as `recog_container:api`, and build from the current context (`.`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the Docker Container**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   With the image built, you can now run the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -p 5000:5000 -d recog_container:api\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This runs the container and maps port 5000 on your machine to port 5000 on the container. The `-d` flag tells Docker to run the container in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Access the Application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Once the container is running, you should be able to access your Flask app by navigating to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   [http://localhost:5000/upload](http://localhost:5000/upload)\n"

    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   heroku container:push web --app your-app-name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This pushes the Docker container of your app to Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Release the Application**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   heroku container:release web --app your-app-name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will release your app, making it accessible via the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Open & View Your App**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can either navigate to your app's URL in the browser (which is usually in the format `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/`) or you can use the Heroku CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   heroku open --app your-app-name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Optional - Setting Up Config Vars**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   If your app relies on environment variables, you can set them on Heroku through the dashboard or the CLI. For instance:\n",
