    "# Setting up CI/CD using GitHub Actions and Makefiles \n",
    "## 1. Set Up a GitHub Repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub. Then, clone the repository to your local machine:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone machine-learning-operations\n",
    "cd machine-learning-operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Create a Simple Makefile:\n",
    "\n",
    "In your project's root directory, create a `Makefile`. Here's an example for a Python application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Makefile\n",
    "install:\n",
    "\tpip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "test:\n",
    "\tpython -m unittest discover\n",
    "\n",
    "lint:\n",
    "\tflake8 src/\n",
    "\n",
    "run:\n",
    "\tpython src/app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Makefile` has four targets: `install`, `test`, `lint`, and `run`, which will install dependencies, run tests, lint the code, and run the app, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Set Up GitHub Actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Create a Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory and inside it, add a new file for your workflow, e.g., `main.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Define the Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example workflow for a Python application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "name: Python CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches: [ main ]\n",
    "  pull_request:\n",
    "    branches: [ main ]\n",
    "\n",
    "jobs:\n",
    "  build:\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n",
    "\n",
    "    steps:\n",
    "    - name: Checkout code\n",
    "      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Set up Python\n",
    "      uses: actions/setup-python@v2\n",
    "      with:\n",
    "        python-version: 3.8\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Install dependencies\n",
    "      run: make install\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Lint\n",
    "      run: make lint\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Run Tests\n",
    "      run: make test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow runs whenever there's a `push` or `pull_request` event on the `main` branch. It sets up a Python environment, checks out your code, installs dependencies, lints the code, and runs tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Commit and Push the Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .github/workflows/main.yml\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add GitHub Actions workflow\"\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After pushing, you should see the GitHub Actions workflow run automatically in the \"Actions\" tab of your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Expand the CI/CD Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to deploy your application automatically after testing, extend the GitHub Actions workflow. The exact steps depend on where and how you want to deploy. Here's a basic example for deploying a Python app to Heroku:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following to your `main.yml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  deploy:\n",
    "    needs: build\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n",
    "    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'\n",
    "\n",
    "    steps:\n",
    "    - name: Checkout code\n",
    "      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n",
    "\n",
    "    - name: Deploy to Heroku\n",
    "      uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.5.7\n",
    "      with:\n",
    "        heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n",
    "        heroku_app_name: \"your-heroku-app-name\"\n",
    "        heroku_email: \"your-email@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to set the `HEROKU_API_KEY` in your repository's secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Monitor Your CI/CD:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularly check the \"Actions\" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of your workflows. If there's a failure, GitHub will highlight which step failed, making debugging easier.\n"
