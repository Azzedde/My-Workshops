    "## Monitoring Docker Containers with Prometheus and Grafana\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prometheus Logo](./promotheus.png)\n",
    "![Grafana Logo](./grafana.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Prometheus and Grafana\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prometheus**: An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, and displays the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grafana**: An open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows querying, visualization, alerting, and exploring metrics from various data sources like Prometheus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Prometheus and Grafana?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Both are widely adopted in the industry.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Integration**: Prometheus and Grafana integrate smoothly, providing a comprehensive monitoring solution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Flexibility**: They support multiple data sources and plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Monitor Your Docker Containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Docker**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If not, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run Prometheus in a Docker Container**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We'll pull a Prometheus Docker image and run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --name=prometheus prom/prometheus:v2.30.3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Prometheus for Docker**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   global:\n",
    "     scrape_interval: 15s\n",
    "\n",
    "   scrape_configs:\n",
    "     - job_name: 'docker'\n",
    "       static_configs:\n",
    "       - targets: ['your-docker-host:9323']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, replace `your-docker-host` with your Docker host address.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run Grafana in a Docker Container**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Pull and run Grafana:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana grafana/grafana:8.3.3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000/` using the default `admin` for both username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connect Prometheus to Grafana**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   In Grafana:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Click on the gear icon (⚙️) on the left side panel.\n",
    "   - Click `Data Sources` > `Add data source`.\n",
    "   - Choose `Prometheus`.\n",
    "   - Set the URL to `http://your-docker-host:9090` and click `Save & Test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Set Up Dashboards**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   With Grafana, you can either create your own dashboards or import community-created ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For monitoring Docker, you can import a pre-made dashboard. Click `+` on the left panel, select `Import`, and use the dashboard ID `893` (a popular Docker dashboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **View Your Metrics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Once set up, navigate to your dashboards in Grafana. You'll see real-time metrics from your Docker containers, gathered by Prometheus and visualized by Grafana.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Optional - Alerts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Grafana provides robust alerting options. You can set up alerts based on specific thresholds or conditions related to your Docker metrics.\n"
