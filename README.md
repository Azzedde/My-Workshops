### Building GPT from scratch (a smaller version)

Organized by my club School of AI Algiers and in collaboration with Mr. Abdelghani Kabor, this workshop delved into:
- What are LLMs ? How are they used today ? How companies will embrace them ? What are the problems of LLMs ?
- The "not yet" perspective of LLMs and the need of scaling to emmerge new tasks for neural networks to perform.
- What is GPT exactly and why is it so powerful ?
- A small dive into the Transformer architecture and its components.
- Building a small GPT version that performs text generation character by character. (Inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=psXPE9kV3f-VyffC)
